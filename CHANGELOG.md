# Slate release history

Version 1 is everything built before the first efficiency pass. Version 2 is everything from that pass up to Nov 11, 2026, ending with the build below.
From 2.0.0 on, every change gets a new number: fixes and tweaks bump the last number (2.0.1), new features the middle one (2.1.0).

## 2.3.3 (Nov 11, 2026)
- Faster live updates while the app is open: slate scores and the open game's box score every 10 seconds (was 30); other live games every minute (was 2).
- Date picker: the month and the day are the same size.

## 2.3.2 (Nov 11, 2026)
- The refresh button at the top now resets the app: it reloads the newest version with fresh data, which fixes anything stuck.
- Removed the Refresh link at the bottom of the slate (scores and games update on their own).

## 2.3.1 (Nov 11, 2026)
- Folding the phone no longer leaves the menu scrolling with the page: the app resets its zoom and size right after a fold.

## 2.3.0 (Nov 11, 2026)
- Release history is viewable in the app: Settings > What's new.

## 2.2.3 (Nov 11, 2026)
- Player headshots no longer show initials behind the photo. Initials appear only when a player has no photo.

## 2.2.2 (Nov 11, 2026)
- Box Office: the league tabs stay in place when you swipe between leagues. Long names like Premier League and Champions League no longer jump out of view.

## 2.2.1 (Nov 11, 2026)
- Quick box score (matchup dropdown on the slate): the picked team's stats show as a sideways-scrolling row under the team tabs, like the full box score.
- Teams: more columns on a wide upright screen, and two columns on the right side when unfolded sideways.
- Box Office: two columns of players on a wide upright screen.

## 2.2.0 (Nov 11, 2026)
- Box Office can be built for any past night and any league with a free "Build this night's Box Office" button (ready within about 10 minutes).
- New Box Office leagues: NHL, women's college basketball (WCBB) and Champions League, plus MLB and WNBA during their seasons.

## 2.1.1 (Nov 11, 2026)
- Quick box score: team stats moved above the players.
- Box Office: two-column layout when unfolded and held upright.

## 2.1.0 (Nov 11, 2026)
- Phone alerts come from Slate itself as push notifications, at no cost: reminders, finals, live scores, upset watch and the daily brief, with the same settings as before.
- New "This phone" switch in Settings > Notifications to turn alerts on for each phone (works for your brother's phone too).
- The hourly Claude alerts run is retired.

## 2.0.0 (Nov 11, 2026): efficiency release
- Claude only writes when you tap a button. Nothing that costs money runs on its own.
- Live highlights under games are written by the app's own rules (free) instead of Claude.
- Box Office: top performers and wild finishes are built free each morning; Claude's over and underachievers are written only when you tap.
- Fewer web searches per Claude summary (preview 2, team 2, recap 1, Box Office 2), which lowers the cost of each summary.
- The day slates (every game, today plus three days) are built by a free script instead of a daily Claude run, and "Build slate" requests go through the same free job.
- The version number now shows in Settings.
